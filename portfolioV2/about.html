            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Benjamin Terdin, and I live in Sweden. I’m currently in my second year of high school, where I’m focusing on Software Engineering. I have taken a strong liking for designing and coding websites, often combining my creativity with technical skills. I enjoy using Figma to create detailed prototypes, ensuring that my designs are visually appealing and user-friendly before translating them into code. <br><br> For development, I primarily work with HTML and CSS, which I use to bring my designs to life. I find great satisfaction in seeing a concept evolve from an idea to a fully functional webpage. <br><br> Currently, I’m also exploring C#, which I find fascinating, though I’m still in the early stages of mastering it. I’m excited to deepen my knowledge and expand my skill set in this area as I continue my studies and projects. <br><br> Future goals is to be able to understand and code in multiple coding languages and someday become a fullstack developer for a bigger company, or create my own.</p>
